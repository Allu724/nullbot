💭 Project Description

NullBot is a conversational interface that says… absolutely nothing useful. It exists purely to simulate a chatbot without the burden of logic, emotion, or helpfulness.


🚫 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

In today’s world of hyper-productivity and AI overload, people are burdened with answers to questions they didn’t ask. Chatbots keep helping, thinking, suggesting...
What if we just had one that doesn’t?

🪄 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

Introducing NullBot: a UI-rich, mind-empty chatbot that offers the illusion of intelligence while doing nothing at all. It responds with vague affirmations, circular logic, or complete silence.
A perfect companion for when you need background noise without actual conversation.

🛠️ Technical Details

Lang used: TypeScript, JavaScript
Framework used: Next.js (App Router), React
Styling: Tailwind CSS
UI Components: shadcn/ui
UI Generator: v0.dev
Deployment: Vercel

Libraries used:
lucide-react (icons)
clsx (conditional class handling)
tailwind-variants (component variants)
zod or react-hook-form (optional, for forms if any)
@radix-ui/react-* (used internally via shadcn/ui)

Tools used:
v0.dev (code generation)
Git & GitHub (version control)
ESLint & Prettier (linting and formatting)
Vercel CLI (deployment)
VS Code (code editing)
Chrome DevTools (debugging or just admiring the empty bot)


🧩 Implementation (Software)

NullBot is a frontend-only project built using React (Next.js App Router), with a clean and modern UI generated via v0.dev. The design mimics an intelligent chatbot interface — but intentionally lacks logic or backend processing.

🔧 Key Software Components
Next.js App Router:
Manages routing and layout structure with app directory convention.

Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui:
Handles styling and components (e.g., cards, buttons, inputs) to create a polished but non-functional interface.

Main Files:
page.tsx: Entry point for the home page.
components/ChatPopup.tsx: Core UI element that looks like a chatbot window.
components/Header.tsx, Sidebar.tsx: Used for navigation layout — purely aesthetic.

No Backend / Logic:
NullBot doesn’t fetch, store, or respond intelligently. Input fields exist, but the bot’s “response” is either hardcoded or missing altogether — by design.

Deployed via Vercel:
Static frontend hosted with zero server interaction.
